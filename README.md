# Spam Classification using Naive Bayes

## Description
This project implements an SMS spam classification system using the Naive Bayes algorithm. Text messages are converted into numerical features using CountVectorizer, and a Naive Bayes classifier is trained to predict whether a message is Spam or Ham.

The notebook demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, label encoding, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Approach
- Label Encoding (spam → 1, ham → 0)
- Feature Extraction using CountVectorizer
- Train–Test Split (80/20)
- Naive Bayes Model Training
- Model Evaluation using Accuracy

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Result
The model achieves approximately 94–95% accuracy on both training and test datasets.
